'Good effort.  Here are suggestions for improving:
'1. Use JavaDoc comments through the program, not just at the top heading. 
'2. Convert entries in text fields from strings to numbers. You get type mismatch run-time error otherwise.
'3. Make the Calculate button default—pressing the Enter should fire it.
'4. Correct the calculations—interior angle calculation is incorrect.
'5. Follow Java's naming convention for class, methods, variables and constants.
'6. Use final definitions for constants and use the Math class methods.
'7. Consider making the Calculations class separate rather than nested.
'8. It is good style to tab code inside each method.
'9. Provide Calculate, Clear, and Quit buttons with accelerator keys.
'10. Use System.exit(0); to exit program.
'11. Set focus to the number of sides text field after Clear.
'12. Change the tab index to indicate correct order of entry.
'13. Name the project appropriately.
'14. All input and output values should be double type except for number of sides (integer).
'15. Clear should clear all text fields and reset the form to its original state.
'16. Provide current date in the form's title.
'17. Provide icon for all forms, including About.
'18. Validate inputs for correct type and range.
'19. Avoid excessive number of class variables-declare variables inside methods.
'20. Clean up the empty procedures code.
'21. Show the form centered as it starts.
'22. Provide range and type check for inputs; do not allow, for example, negative number of sides.
'23. Add menus to the form with meaningful choices.
'24. Set Enabled property to False for all output text fields.
'25. Disable form from maximization or resizing.
'26. Provide ToolTip with meaningful message for the needed controls.
'27. Display results with five decimal places--use DecimalFormat or NumberFormat class.
'28. Give title to form.
'29. Missing required calculations.
'30. Missing meaningful menus without duplicating code,
'31. Provide ability to print invoice.
'32. Provide a meaningful About form.
'33. Program crashes on no input or illegal input--place all code inside try block.
'34. Use Decimal formatter to DecimalFormat formatter = new DecimalFormat("#,##0.########"); for displaying calculations.
'35. Submit complete NetBeans projects in future--had to create one for you.
'36. Print from menu is not functional--call the Print button event handler.
'
'The ones that apply to your project are:
'1, 4, 6, 17, 20, 32, 36
